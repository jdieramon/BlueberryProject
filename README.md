## Weather
Summary of average daily temperatures ([1995-2016](weather.md)) in Beltsville, MD. 

## Optimal Plan  
Identify the optimal qPCR sampling plan within the limits of a given budget by using replicates when they are expected to have the greatest benefit. See an example [here](optimal_Plan.md). 

## Reference Genes  
A set of reference genes for use in real-time qPCR studies of [blueberry](references.md) and related plants of the *Ericaceae* family.

## Rhododendron *spp*
To gain a better understanding of cold acclimation in rhododendron, blueberry and in woody perennials in general, we used the 2D-DIGE technique to analyze the rhododendron [proteome](rhody.md) exposed to freezing temperatures.   

## NBS gene family
Genome-scale examination of the [NBS-encoding](nbs.md) gene family.
