Here, we provide an important resource for the identification of functional
R-genes. In this study, we searched for and found a total of **106 NBS-encoding genes** in the current 
blueberry genome (Aug. 2017). The NBS genes were grouped into eleven distinct classes based on 
their domain architecture. More than 22% of the NBS genes are present in clusters. Ten genes 
were mapped onto seven linkage groups. Phylogenetic analysis grouped these genes into two major 
clusters based on their structural variation.
