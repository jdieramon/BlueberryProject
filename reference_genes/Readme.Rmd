We have described an excellent set of reference genes for use in real-time PCR studies of blueberry and related plants of the *Ericaceae* 
family.  
  
The following figure shows the in silico expression of our new set of reference genes (**A**) and the expression levels of common genes 
used in blueberry research: ACT(red), metallothionein(purple), GAPDH(blue) and EF1a(green) (**B**).
