We have described an excellent set of reference genes for use in real-time PCR studies of blueberry and related plants of the *Ericaceae* 
family.  
  
The following figure shows the in silico expression of our new set of reference genes (**A**) and the expression levels of common genes 
used in blueberry research: ACT, metallothionein, GAPDH and EF1a (**B**).

A. Relative virtual expression of unigenes from the 454 transcriptome database representing putative orthologs to Arabidopsis genes UBC9 (96% and 93% identity at the amino acid level, respectively; red and blue), UBC28 (92% identity; green) and RH8 (45% identity; purple). B. Relative virtual expression of former frequently used blueberry reference genes in qPCR analyses, i.e. ACT (red), metallothionein (purple), GAPDH (blue) and EF1a (green).
