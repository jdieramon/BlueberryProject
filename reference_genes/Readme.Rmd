We have described an excellent set of reference genes for use in real-time qPCR studies of blueberry and related plants of the *Ericaceae* 
family.  
  
The following figure shows the *in silico* expression of (**A**) our new set of reference genes and, (**B**) the expression levels of common genes used in blueberry research: ACT (red), metallothionein (purple), GAPDH (blue) and EF1a (green).
